# Employee Management System

    
## [Description](#description)
    
For this project I have been assigned with creating from scratch, a console application that allows a business admistrator to keep track of the employees, roles, and departments associated with a particular employer's operations.
    
### Motivation
    
The motivation for this project comes from employer's need to be able to view and manage various aspects regaurding employees, thier roles, and the departments those roles belong to, in order to organize and plan business operations.
    
### Problems Solved 
    
The problems I encountered while developing this application were primarily associated with getting data into and out of the data base. MySQL has a few versions that use different syntax. Making sure I referenced the correct manual for the proper syntax heavily effected the efficiency and productivity of the development process. Utilizing MySQL Workspace was also very helpfull providing the proper syntax for certain queries through a GUI and a prompt wich displayed the code neccessary to implement queries directly.
    
### What I learned 
    
During this development process I learned how to utilize various resources that help increase productivity and efficiency. I also learned how databases are structured, what role they play in different applications and how to interact with and utilize it's resources.
